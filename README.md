### Hi, I'm Mahmoud ðŸ‘‹  

**Software Engineer @Invygo | ex-Dell, Orange | GSoC @Chromium (Google Summer of Code)**  

I enjoy building things that actually solve problems. Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve worked on everything from car-rental platforms and fintech integrations to AI-powered tools that listen, learn and act like **ActionGPT.app**, a Chrome extension that uses real-time audio and LLMs to help people get work done faster

Iâ€™ve contributed to **Chromium** through **Google Summer of Code** where I developed an internal debugging page for **WebXR**
The project helped developers inspect, monitor and debug XR sessions (like AR/VR pages) directly inside Chrome similar to how the browserâ€™s history or performance pages work
That experience gave me deep insights into large-scale codebases, web performance and the open-source workflow used by Google engineers.  

Iâ€™ve also worked at **Dell** on scalable backend systems and at **Orange** on enterprise software solutions.  
These experiences taught me how to design reliable systems that balance performance, simplicity and real-world impact

#### What Iâ€™m into
- Backend systems (Node.js, Kotlin, Spring Boot)  
- Observability & reliability (OpenTelemetry, Honeycomb, Prometheus, Grafana)  
- AI & LLM applications (speech-to-text, RAG, real-time audio)  
- Building SaaS tools that make life easier  

#### Side projects
- **ActionGPT.app** Chrome extension that listens to meetings, answers questions, and generates action items  
- **FleetTrack** GPS tracking system for vehicles (real-time location & mileage updates)
